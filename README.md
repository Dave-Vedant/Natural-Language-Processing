# Natural_Laguage_Processing

### It contains Projects and exercise files on google colab platform. 
### The Library which used is NLTK for text data exploration, cleaning process, tokeninig creation, stemming, lemmatizing of data.
### As per requirement I use future engineering concpets and for speedup the process vectorization concept is used.
### Use advanced [ML pipeline](https://github.com/vedantdave77/NLP-Natural_Laguage_Processing_Machine_Learning/blob/master/Random_forest(NLP).ipynb) Random Forest, Gradient_Boosting for checking the data accuracy and NLP process confidence improvement.

### One Kaggle dataset [Project of yelp](https://github.com/vedantdave77/NLP-Natural_Laguage_Processing_Machine_Learning/blob/master/03_NLP_Project(Kaggle)_My_Solutions.ipynb) data is used for the main project.
